# A Universal Windows Platform Application
#### *Mobile Applications Development Module - Lecturer: Damien Costello - 4th Year Software Development*
For my project in Mobile Applications Development, I am required to create a Windows 10 UWP application in [Visual Studio](https://www.python.org/).  The application should incorporate the following elements:
- A responsive UI across the Windows 10 devices. There are some available for testing and this includes the IoT core, mobile devices, tablet and PC. This includes Visual State Management and using available SDKs for individual device types.
- A UI that has been well designed and is fit for purpose.  User Experience should be carefully considered while developing the application. The User Experience should be consistent across devices.
- Mobile services for data storage and retrieval. The cloud service does not have to be written in C# to be able to interact with a UWP. The preferred cloud to use is Azure.
- Use of the MVVM design pattern in the development approach.
